# HealthCare
# I have made this app for Kratin Drive Assesment.

Its a health care app for online appointments of patients with doctor.

 In this app:
 
 1)Patient registers himself/herself in the app 
 2)Patient sees the list of doctors with different specializations 
 3)Clicks on the doctor with whom he wants to book an appointment
 4)Fills the health complaint form 
 5)The appointment request goes to the doctor
 6)The doctor approves the appointment and places the date , time of appointment and online meeting link in the appointment.
 7)Patient receives the appointment approval mail with meeting link on his/her mail id and also the appointment details like meet link can be seen on the app's dashboard too.
 8)Both Patient and Doctor join the meeting on the given date and time.
 9)After the meeting , doctor updates the appointment and adds the prescription in the appointment.
 10)Patient receives the mail with doctor's prescription.
 11)The appointment details such as prescription , doctor details, appointment date time can be seen on the app's dashboard too.
 12)Later the patient can order the medicines mentioned in prescription from online medicine ecommerce (like 1 mg)

In this way , the whole appointment procedure can be easily done online.
The technology stack used fo this app is : Django -REST Framework and React Js
